# Regression Methods From Scratch
## SARCOS Data Set
All models with be ran using the SARCOS data set and there performance assessed. SARCOS is an inverse dynamics problem for a seven degrees-of-freedom SARCOS anthropomorphic robot arm. The data set contains 21 input dimensions and one output dimension.

## Toy Problem
In  order  to  validate  the  regression  models  a  toy  problem  was  created.  The toy problem was designed to be a simple noise free data set so that the results can be easily predicted. It was designed to be non-linear and two dimensional in order to test the capability of all the models. The following equation was used to generate 500 data points for the toy data set.
